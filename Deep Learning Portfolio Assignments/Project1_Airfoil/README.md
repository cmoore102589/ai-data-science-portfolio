# Airfoil Self-Noise Prediction Using Regression Models

## Overview
This project explores the prediction of scaled sound pressure levels (in decibels) generated by airfoil blade sections using aerodynamic features. As a data scientist at NASA, the objective was to compare traditional linear regression with deep learning approaches to build effective predictive models.

## Problem Statement
Given a dataset from aerodynamic tests of airfoil blade sections, the goal is to model and predict the **Scaled Sound Pressure Level (SSP)** based on five continuous input features:
- Frequency (Hz)
- Angle of Attack (degrees)
- Chord Length (meters)
- Free-Stream Velocity (m/s)
- Suction Side Displacement Thickness (m)

## Approach

### 1. **Data Cleaning and Exploration**
- Loaded and renamed dataset columns.
- Verified dataset structure and missing values.

### 2. **Baseline Model**
- Trained a simple Linear Regression model.
- Evaluated model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

### 3. **Deep Learning Models**
- Implemented and evaluated:
  - A basic neural network using TensorFlow/Keras.
  - An improved neural network with increased hidden units.
  - Equivalent models in PyTorch with increasing model complexity.

### 4. **Evaluation Metrics**
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) was used to compare model performance across all experiments.
