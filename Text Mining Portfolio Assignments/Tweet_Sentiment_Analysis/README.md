# Project 6 â€“ Tweet Sentiment Classification (Sentiment140 Dataset)

## Overview

This project focuses on building machine learning models to classify the sentiment of tweets using the Sentiment140 dataset. The process involves text preprocessing, vectorization, and classification using:
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- Hyperparameter optimization with **GridSearchCV**

## Objectives

- Perform text cleaning and tokenization using NLTK and spaCy
- Implement TF-IDF vectorization to represent tweet data numerically
- Train baseline and optimized models to classify sentiment
- Evaluate model performance using classification metrics

## Practical Applications

This pipeline mirrors tools used in:
- **Customer sentiment monitoring**: Automatically categorize user tweets into positive, negative, or neutral for brands or service providers.
- **Reputation management**: Identify and escalate high-risk customer feedback.
- **Trend forecasting**: Aggregated sentiment scores help predict market shifts or public mood.

Implementing such sentiment analysis can help companies and researchers quickly distill actionable insights from vast social media streams and make data-informed decisions at scale.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK, spaCy
- TF-IDF Vectorization, SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
