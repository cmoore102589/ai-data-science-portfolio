# Fundamentals of AI - Project Part II

## Overview
This project focuses on classic AI search algorithms to solve navigation and pathfinding problems. It evaluates algorithms like BFS, DFS, UCS, Greedy Best-First Search, and A* to identify optimal paths in structured environments.

## Key Features
- Comparative analysis of uninformed and informed search methods.
- Implementation of heuristic functions for real-world inspired problems.
- Visualization of search paths and algorithm performance.

## Practical Application
Search algorithms are the backbone of many AI-driven systems where optimal decision-making is crucial:
- **Navigation systems (e.g., GPS)** utilize algorithms like A* to calculate optimal routes considering time, distance, or traffic, directly enhancing commuter experience and reducing carbon emissions via efficient travel.
- **Robotics** apply pathfinding algorithms to safely navigate dynamic environments, such as warehouse robots optimizing travel paths to retrieve products faster.
- **Game development** leverages these algorithms for non-player character (NPC) movement, creating immersive and responsive gameplay that reacts intelligently to player actions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Heuristic Design
- Search Visualization
