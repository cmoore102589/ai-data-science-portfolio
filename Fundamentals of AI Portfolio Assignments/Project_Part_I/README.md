# Fundamentals of AI - Project Part I

## Overview
This project explores the foundational concept of intelligent agents through the development of reflex and model-based agent simulations. These agents operate within dynamic environments, making real-time decisions based on perceptual inputs and, in advanced cases, internal state tracking.

## Key Features
- Implementation of simple reflex agents with rule-based logic.
- Development of model-based agents capable of inferring environmental conditions.
- Analysis of agent behavior and efficiency under various perceptual conditions.

## Practical Application
Reflex and model-based agents are critical in systems that require low-latency, real-time decision-making. For instance:
- **Smart home systems** can use reflex-based logic to trigger climate control or lighting adjustments based on sensor inputs, improving energy efficiency and user comfort without heavy computation.
- **Autonomous delivery robots** benefit from model-based approaches to anticipate environmental changes (e.g., obstacles) and adjust their routes in real-time.
- **Industrial automation systems** employ similar agents to manage machinery states, detect faults, and initiate immediate responses, thereby minimizing downtime and maximizing safety.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Agent-based modeling
