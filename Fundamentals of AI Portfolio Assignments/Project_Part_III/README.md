# Fundamentals of AI - Project Part III

## Overview
This project applies Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to solve the Job Assignment Problem, showcasing the ability of evolutionary strategies to optimize complex, non-linear problem spaces. It models fitness, mutation, and crossover to evolve optimal agent-job assignments.

## Key Features
- Built a genetic algorithm from scratch with selection, crossover, and mutation logic.
- Evaluated multiple generations for convergence and solution quality.
- Visualized fitness score evolution and assignment efficiency.

## Practical Application
Genetic Algorithms provide adaptive and scalable solutions to optimization challenges where traditional methods may fail:
- **Workforce scheduling**: GAs can assign shifts across large teams with varying constraints, ensuring balanced workloads and operational efficiency in sectors like healthcare or logistics.
- **Cloud resource allocation**: In data centers, GAs optimize how virtual machines are distributed across physical servers, improving utilization while minimizing energy costs.
- **Complex design problems**: From circuit layouts to mechanical structures, GAs enable discovery of innovative configurations that meet design criteria without exhaustive brute-force methods, saving time and computational resources.
