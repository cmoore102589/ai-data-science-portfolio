# Fundamentals of AI - Project Part II

## Overview
This module deep-dives into classic search algorithms to solve pathfinding and decision-making problems. It includes implementations and comparisons of BFS, DFS, UCS, GBF, and A* algorithms in structured grid environments.

## Key Features
- Implemented uninformed and informed search algorithms.
- Visualized agent pathfinding across grid-based maps.
- Compared performance and efficiency based on heuristic quality.

## Practical Application
Search algorithms form the foundation of:
- GPS systems that compute shortest or safest travel routes.
- Game AI where NPCs plan movements.
- Robotics path planning in warehouse and rescue missions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Heuristic Design
- Search Visualization
