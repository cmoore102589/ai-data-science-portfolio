👨🏾‍💻 AI & Machine Learning Portfolio — Matthew C. Moore
Welcome to my collection of applied AI and machine learning projects, built during my Master’s in Artificial Intelligence and extended through personal exploration, curiosity, and a lot of hands-on experimentation.

These aren’t just assignments—I treat each project like a mini-case study. Whether I’m training a neural network, building a reinforcement learning agent, or diving into NLP, I approach it with a practical mindset and a commitment to learning how AI can be used to solve real problems.

🧭 What You’ll Find Here
This repo is organized into focused areas of study. Every folder includes Jupyter Notebooks, HTML reports, and quick summaries to help you understand the why and the how behind each project.

📂 Project Areas
🧠 Deep Learning
Neural networks applied to real-world classification and prediction tasks, including structured healthcare-style datasets and other supervised learning problems.

📊 Text Mining
Sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and document classification—all rooted in building pipelines that extract insights from messy human language.

🕹️ Reinforcement Learning
Agents that learn from scratch—CartPole, LunarLander, and more. Each project reflects experiments with reward functions, policies, and decision-making under uncertainty.

🧮 Core AI & ML
Foundational algorithms, lab-style exercises, and statistical explorations. These sharpened my understanding of what’s under the hood of today’s AI tools.

🤖 Robotics
Hands-on programming with the ELEGOO robot kit. Sensor data, embedded logic, and the joy of watching physical hardware respond to your code.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python (pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, XGBoost)

Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly

Dev Tools: JupyterLab, PyCharm, Git, GitHub

🗂️ Repo Structure
Every project folder includes:

*.ipynb — Jupyter Notebook with code and explanations

README.md — Summary of the project’s goal, process, and key takeaways

*.html — Rendered reports or visualizations (when applicable)

The goal is clarity, not just code. I want you to understand what the model is doing and why the project matters.
