# AI & Machine Learning Portfolio by Matthew Moore

Welcome to my portfolio showcasing practical projects completed during my Master‚Äôs program in Artificial Intelligence and through independent exploration. These projects reflect hands-on experience across a range of AI disciplines including deep learning, text mining, reinforcement learning, and robotics.

Each folder in this repository represents a themed area of applied machine learning, with Jupyter Notebooks, HTML visualizations, and supporting documentation.

## üìÅ Project Categories

### üß† Deep Learning
Projects focused on neural networks and supervised learning for tasks such as classification and medical risk prediction.

### üîç Text Mining
End-to-end NLP pipelines including sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and document classification.

### üïπÔ∏è Reinforcement Learning
Interactive agents trained using reward-based learning environments, with experiments implemented in Python.

### üßÆ Fundamentals of AI
Core statistical and ML concepts applied in structured experiments and lab-style assignments.

### ü§ñ Robotics
Programming for embedded systems using the ELEGOO robot kit, integrating sensor data and basic autonomy.

## üìå How to Navigate

- Each folder contains:
  - `*.ipynb`: The original Jupyter Notebook code.
  - `*.html`: Rendered reports or lab results (where applicable).
  - `README.md`: A short summary of objectives, methods, and key takeaways.

- The projects are organized to highlight **problem-solving**, **technical fluency**, and **real-world relevance**.

## üîß Tech Stack

- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, XGBoost)
- JupyterLab & PyCharm
- Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly
- Git & GitHub for version control and collaboration
