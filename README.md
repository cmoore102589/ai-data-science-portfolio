# üë®üèæ‚Äçüíª AI & Machine Learning Portfolio ‚Äî Matthew C. Moore

Welcome to my collection of applied AI and machine learning projects, built during my Master‚Äôs in Artificial Intelligence and extended through personal exploration, curiosity, and a lot of hands-on experimentation.

These aren‚Äôt just assignments‚ÄîI treat each project like a mini-case study. Whether I‚Äôm training a neural network, building a reinforcement learning agent, or diving into NLP, I approach it with a practical mindset and a commitment to learning how AI can be used to solve real problems.

## üß≠ What You‚Äôll Find Here

This repo is organized into focused areas of study. Every folder includes Jupyter Notebooks, HTML reports, and quick summaries to help you understand the **why** and the **how** behind each project.

## üìÇ Project Areas

### üß† Deep Learning  
Neural networks applied to real-world classification and prediction tasks, including structured healthcare-style datasets and other supervised learning problems.

### üìä Text Mining  
Sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and document classification‚Äîall rooted in building pipelines that extract insights from messy human language.

### üïπÔ∏è Reinforcement Learning  
Agents that learn from scratch‚ÄîCartPole, LunarLander, and more. Each project reflects experiments with reward functions, policies, and decision-making under uncertainty.

### üßÆ Core AI & ML  
Foundational algorithms, lab-style exercises, and statistical explorations. These sharpened my understanding of what‚Äôs under the hood of today‚Äôs AI tools.

### ü§ñ Robotics  
Hands-on programming with the ELEGOO robot kit. Sensor data, embedded logic, and the joy of watching physical hardware respond to your code.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries

- **Python** (pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, XGBoost)
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly
- **Dev Tools**: JupyterLab, PyCharm, Git, GitHub

## üóÇÔ∏è Repo Structure

Every project folder includes:

- `*.ipynb` ‚Äî Jupyter Notebook with code and explanations  
- `README.md` ‚Äî Summary of the project‚Äôs goal, process, and key takeaways  
- `*.html` ‚Äî Rendered reports or visualizations (when applicable)

The goal is clarity, not just code. I want you to understand what the model is doing and *why* the project matters.
