# Q-Learning in Dynamic Environments

## Overview
This project applies Q-Learning to environments with dynamic changes, testing the algorithm's adaptability and robustness.

## Features
- Q-Learning implementation
- Environment with changing dynamics
- Performance evaluation over time

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the training script: `python train_q_learning.py`

## Results
The Q-Learning agent adapts to environmental changes, maintaining performance through continuous learning.

## Acknowledgments
Inspired by foundational Q-Learning research and adapted for dynamic scenarios.
