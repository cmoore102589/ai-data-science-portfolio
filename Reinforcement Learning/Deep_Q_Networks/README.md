# Deep Q-Networks (DQN)

## Overview
This project implements Deep Q-Networks to enable agents to learn optimal policies in discrete action spaces using deep learning.

## Features
- Experience replay buffer
- Target network for stability
- Epsilon-greedy exploration strategy

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the training script: `python train_dqn.py`

## Results
The DQN agent learns to perform tasks effectively, with performance improving over time as observed in training logs.

## Acknowledgments
Based on the DQN algorithm introduced by DeepMind.
