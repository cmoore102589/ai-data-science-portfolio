# Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning

## Overview
This project implements the Actor-Critic method, combining policy-based and value-based approaches to reinforcement learning for improved efficiency.

## Features
- Separate actor and critic networks
- Continuous action space handling
- Training and evaluation scripts

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the training script: `python train_actor_critic.py`

## Results
The Actor-Critic method achieves faster convergence compared to traditional methods, with stable policy learning.

## Acknowledgments
