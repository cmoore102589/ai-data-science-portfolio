# PPO with Custom Environments

## Overview
This project implements the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to train agents in custom-designed environments. The focus is on adapting PPO to unique scenarios, showcasing its flexibility and robustness.

## Features
- Custom environment integration
- PPO algorithm implementation
- Training performance visualization

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the training script: `python train_ppo.py`

## Results
The agent successfully learns optimal policies in the custom environment, demonstrating PPO's effectiveness in diverse scenarios.

## Acknowledgments
Inspired by OpenAI's PPO implementation and adapted for custom environments.
